# pi-prompt-history

A Pi extension that restores a previous prompt with a fuzzy picker.

## Use

- Press the configured shortcut (default **Ctrl+R**) at any time, or run `/history`. The picker opens inline in Pi's editor area so transcript images cannot cover it.
- Type to fuzzy-filter prompts from the **current session's active branch**. The most recently used prompt is listed first by default.
- Press `Tab` to cycle through **This session → This workspace → Global**. Workspace history includes saved sessions from the current working directory (plus the current session); global history includes every saved Pi session and the local history retained for ephemeral sessions. Workspace and global results show use count and last-used time. The first global search builds a local cache; later searches reuse it. Press `Ctrl+G` to rebuild that cache from the saved sessions.
- Use `↑` / `↓` to select a result, then `Enter` to put it back into Pi's editor.
- It only restores text; it does **not** submit the prompt.
- `Esc` or `Ctrl+C` dismisses the picker.

The search ranks in-order character matches and gives preference to consecutive and word-boundary matches. Repeated prompts appear once, prioritizing their most recent use. The global history is stored locally in `~/.pi/agent/pi-prompt-history-history.json`; it starts collecting prompts after this version is installed.

## Configure the shortcut

The default picker shortcut is `Ctrl+R`. To change it globally without editing the installed package, create `~/.pi/agent/pi-prompt-history.json`:

```json
{
  "shortcut": "alt+r",
  "globalHistoryLimit": 1000
}
```

The `PI_PROMPT_HISTORY_SHORTCUT` environment variable takes precedence for one Pi launch:

```sh
PI_PROMPT_HISTORY_SHORTCUT=alt+r pi
```

Use any Pi keybinding format (for example `alt+r` or `ctrl+shift+r`). If the selected key conflicts with a built-in Pi shortcut, Pi reports the conflict at startup and `/history` remains available.

## Install

Install the v0.3.3 release from npm:

```sh
pi install npm:@light4/pi-prompt-history@0.3.3
```

Or install the same release from GitHub: `pi install git:github.com/light4/pi-prompt-history@v0.3.3`.

After changing the shortcut configuration, restart Pi or run `/reload`.

## Install for local development

Pi auto-discovers an extension whose directory contains `index.ts`. Symlink this repository's source directory into the global extension directory:

```sh
ln -sfn /Users/chenyuanning/sources/pi-prompt-history/src \
  ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-prompt-history
```

Then start Pi or run `/reload` in an existing session.

For a one-off test without installing it globally:

```sh
pi -e /Users/chenyuanning/sources/pi-prompt-history/src/index.ts
```

## Scope and privacy

The extension reads the active session, saved sessions for the current workspace or all workspaces, and maintains a local global-history cache at `~/.pi/agent/pi-prompt-history-history.json` (including prompts from ephemeral sessions). It does not send prompt data over the network. Press `Ctrl+G` in the picker, or delete that file, to rebuild the cache from saved sessions.

## Development

Run `pnpm install`, `pnpm run typecheck`, and `pnpm test`. The extension is TypeScript interpreted by Pi's extension loader and deliberately has no npm runtime dependencies. Test it manually by sending a few prompts, then invoking `Ctrl+R` or `/history`.

## Release

Bump `package.json` and the install examples above, commit, and push a matching `vX.Y.Z` tag. Publish a GitHub Release for that tag; [publish.yml](.github/workflows/publish.yml) verifies the version, runs checks, and publishes to npm with provenance via OIDC. No npm token is stored in GitHub.

One-time setup by the npm package owner (requires npm 11.19+ and 2FA):

```sh
npm trust github @light4/pi-prompt-history --repo light4/pi-prompt-history --file publish.yml --allow-publish --yes
```

If publishing fails, fix the cause and rerun the failed GitHub Actions job. Confirm both the GitHub Release and npm version before updating consumers.
